### Tutorial 1 Targets

* Understand more concepts on C Programming and be able to implement more complicated logics
* Learn more about conventions and best practices in programming

## Tutorial 1 Review (Back to Tutorial 0 Links)

First of all, we will make sure that you can flash code into our board using STM32CubeIDE:

Please review the CubeIDE installation method on

* [02) Where to Write Code](../tutorial-0-self-learn-basic-c/02-where-to-write-code.md) 

We will start reviewing variables and operator, then emphasizing control flow

* [04) Variables and Input-Output](../tutorial-0-self-learn-basic-c/04-variable-io.md)
* [05) Operators](../tutorial-0-self-learn-basic-c/05-operators.md)
* [07) Control Flow](../tutorial-0-self-learn-basic-c/07-control-flow.md)

## Tutorial 1 Materials

Materials to Introduce in Tutorial 1:

> Concepts that are less important but are still worth a quick read before moving on to the next part are marked with `*`

* [08) Array and String](08-array-string.md)
  * [Arrays](08-array-string.md#arrays)
  * [Strings (array of `char`)](08-array-string.md#string-character-array)
  * [`string.h` library*](08-array-string.md#the-stringh-library)
  * [Self Tests](08-array-string.md#self-test)
* [09) Functions](09-functions.md) 
  * [Function Definition and Calls](09-functions.md#function-definition-and-call)
  * [Passing Arrays](09-functions.md#pass-an-array-to-a-function)
  * [How to Modify Non-Array Variables*](09-functions.md#how-to-modify-non-array-variables-in-functions)
  * [Function Declaration*](09-functions.md#function-declaration)
  * [Self Tests](09-functions.md#self-tests)
* [10) Structs and Enums](10-struct.md)
  * [Structs](10-struct.md#struct)
  * [Typedef](10-struct.md#typedef)
  * [Enums](10-struct.md#enum)
  * [Self Tests](10-struct.md#self-test)
* [11) Multi File Programming](11-multi-file-programming.md) (This part is important to understand how workspaces with multiple files works, which is common in robot programming)
  * [File Types](11-multi-file-programming.md#file-types)
  * [How to do Multi File Programming](11-multi-file-programming.md#multi-file-programming-1)
  * [Separate Compilation](11-multi-file-programming.md#separate-compilation)

We will discuss a bit of this material if we have time:

* [12) Recursion*](12-recursion.md)
  * [Self-Tests](12-recursion.md#self-test) 

# Advanced C

Other than those, there are a few more features that we wish you can explore by yourself further...

* [A1) Preprocessors](a1-preprocessor.md)
* [A2) Static and Extern](a2-static-extern.md)
* [A3) Union](a3-union.md)
* [A4) Pointers](a4-pointers.md)

## Classworks

We will have 5 classworks to check your understanding on the materials. They will be linked to after we have finished discussing sufficient material on the topic of the classwork.

However, for a quick link to all of them:

* [Classwork 1: Matrix Addition -- Arrays](classwork/classwork-1-matrix-addition.md)
* [Classwork 2: First Word -- String](classwork/classwork-2-first-word.md)
* [Classwork 3: Area of a Circle -- Functions](classwork/classwork-3-area-of-circle.md)
* [Classwork 4: Greyscale Image -- Struct](classwork/classwork-4-greyscale-image.md)
* [Classwork 5: Mean Median Min Max -- Separate Compilation](classwork/classwork-5-mean-median-min-max/README.md)

## Homeworks

The homework of tutorial 1 will be released later
