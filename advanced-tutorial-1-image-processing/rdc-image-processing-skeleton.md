# RDC 2024 Image Processing Skeleton Code

To complete your AR's task in the Robot Design Contest 2024, you are required to

- identify the position of the Signal Unit(Circle) and the Conducting Unit(Square) inside the 4 boxes with your computer.
- send the detection result to your AR through Bluetooth.

To ensure that teams are actually using detection and not hardcoding the positions of the units, we would like teams to display their detection result with a GUI.

Attached here is a skeleton code that should be helpful in displaying your result.
