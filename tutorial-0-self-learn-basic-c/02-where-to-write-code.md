## Where do I write my code?

### Online Compiler

#### Programiz 

Since some of you may not have installed an **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer yet, you may use an online version to write your code. For your Tutorial 0, [**Programiz**(https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) is a good choice.

#### Online Cpp

For Tutorial 1, as we will start to learn how to work with multiple `.c` `.h` files, [**Online Cpp**(https://online-cpp.com)](https://online-cpp.com) is a good choice for multi file programming 

***However, remember to switch to C instead of C++***

### Github Codespace

As we will start to learn how to work with multiple `.c` files in Tutorial 1 and your homework, please create a workspace on [**Github Codespace**](https://github.com/features/codespaces). The environment is similar to VSCode. However, we do not really recommend setting it up on your machine as it may be troublesome to install the C compiler (unless you already have it installed). Hence, we will use this for now.

However, if you insist to work on your computer's VSCode, please refer to our guide (the tutorial for Windows only):

* [**Windows**](installs/gcc_windows.md)

### CubeIDE

For robotics programming, we will teach you to install [**CubeIDE**](https://www.st.com/content/st\_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-ides/stm32cubeide.html?dl=mDz41Ame3rsvInWnnBOgtQ%3D%3D%2CcZwAba%2BIy%2FG8DrU77U5EEghQuKOCpNSACfvi2bwE08ZENmt9WBEXUiTFvdmySC1TNkz3H0dEAD1mlAg7m066zK%2F%2FEiRsAU9fsh2Z8qjWUeqproTDa74wIxaZNYl1hc8eF0gQr7rlIcOFvgurma6ZSOcIVxYHcXIdvJ5AxC%2BjWa6UGFNZRkS7jDzol8Tpl0jvo%2FAMwRruaLwkCR%2FMlSU58%2BCO7kAgbbpI9k1Vk9wfiVIDHh0oLoPz8srvZAj96TsE29RwNdrqa5DDOqFkNATwOtfq6CcuEy9pRVfVZ3qne5KLKsG0slrZQbhGh4%2FQj8jZ6HR7SsRXbr3AoEgc4EqypbnffnzAqnjfo6JE9Ir0kfR1TifcvX1rsJBK9ih6p%2Fbw%2BnqV22OC7utWyvidL7rQyLfyuw2MzWI7bH8qtlwMkyfOYFJ2k%2Bdkhpuhbe5jf6GM\&uid=Pg30eCicqbj1AXYhNpUwb3QskPXfCpAM#get-software)**,** which is where you will spend the majority of your time during our tutorials. 

You are recommended to set it up **now**, but we will make sure your installation works in the first tutorial. Please refer to our guide:

* [**Windows**](installs/stm32_windows.md)
* [**MacOS**](installs/stm32_macos.md) 

If your computer cannot flash code to the board, please refer to the guide [**here**](installs/stm32_problems.md).

(We hope that it does not take too long for you to setup)
